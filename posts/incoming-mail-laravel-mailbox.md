## Introduction

**Sending** e-mails with laravel couldn't be simpler using the Mail facade, but what if you want to act on **incoming** e-mails instead?

For example, if you want to build a **helpdesk** system, where users can respond to their tickets directly via e-mail. Or maybe you want to publish posts to your **blog** via e-mail.

That's where the ðŸ“¬ [**Laravel Mailbox** ](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/)package by [Marcel Pociot](https://marcelpociot.de/) comes in!

In this post, I want to guide you through the steps to create an application which listens to **incoming** e-mails and perform an action based on its ***sender*** (from), ***recipient address*** (to) or **subject**. Alternatively, you can also catch **all** incoming mail.

## Requirements

### Domain name and Server

You'll need to own a **domain name** with access to its DNS management, a **server** to host the application and a **mail service** that *listens* to incoming e-mail and *forwards* them to the application.

### Mailgun account

Laravel Mailbox offers support for the **mail services** [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) and [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) out of the box. For this article, I chose to use **Mailgun** since I am most familiar with their service and I think they offer a reasonably generous free plan.

### PHPUnit

Since I'll demonstrate driving out the desired functionality using TDD, you will need to have **PHPUnit** working on your system. If you are new to this, I'd recommend to check out [this free video](https://laracasts.com/series/setup-a-mac-dev-machine-from-scratch/episodes/7) on Laracasts.

**Note:** references to "example.com" or "johnbraun.blog" should be replaced by your own domain.

## Setting up Mailgun with your domain name

### Plans

Mailgun offers a **Free plan** which allows you to send 10 000 e-mails / month, limited to a sandbox domain. If you provide your payment details (credit card) you'll be upgraded to the **Concept plan**, which is still free but unlocks the ability to **add custom domains**. Be aware that you'll be charged if you send more than the 10 000 free e-mails. You're allowed to **receive** an **unlimited** number of e-mails.

### Adding a domain

Visit the *domains* page in the *Sending* menu section and choose *Add your domain*. Mailgun will suggest you to use a **subdomain** like *mg.example.com*. However, if we want to be able to receive e-mails on info@example.com (instead of info@mg.example.com) we'll need to ***ignore******the red warning*** and register *example.com*. Choose your region (EU / US) and confirm.

![Warning that we're not using a subdomain](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/mailgun-warning.png)

### Setting up DNS records

After adding a new domain, you'll be asked to add some DNS records:

-   TXT records (2x)
-   MX records (2x)
-   CNAME record (1x)

Those are (most probably) managed by the company you've registered your domain name with.

As long as your registrar supports manual configuration of the DNS records it doesn't matter which company you choose. Personally, I use [Hover](https://www.hover.com) for registration of my **domains** and [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) to mange the **DNS settings** (by directing the nameservers to DigitalOcean) since my **server** lives there as well.

![DNS records](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/DNS-records.png)

Check out these guides for specific configuring of **DNS records** at [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/manage-dns-zone-files-680), [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/579/2237/which-record-type-option-should-i-choose-for-the-information-im-about-to-enter), [Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/support/how-to-manage-advanced-dns-records/), [Rackspace Email & Apps](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/set-up-dns-records-for-cloud-office-email/), [Rackspace Cloud DNS](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/creating-dns-records-with-cloud-dns/), [Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/).

### TXT records

To be able to send e-mail with Mailgun, you'll need to configure two TXT records.

![Expected TXT records](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/expected-TXT-records.png)

First, using the root hostname (using an "@" in DigitalOcean) with the value "`v=spf1 include:eu.mailgun.org ~all`".

![Adding root TXT record](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/root-TXT-record.png)

The second TXT record indicates your domain key using the provided subdomain prefix, "**mailo._domainkey**" in the example below. The specific subdomain you'll need to create will vary.

![Adding domain key TXT record](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/domain-TXT-record.png)

### MX records

Next, to be able to receive e-mails, we'll need to add two MX records.

![Expected MX records](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/expected-MX-records.png) 

Since we're not using a subdomain, we'll add those MX records on our root hostname, which is shown below (for DigitalOcean). **Important:** if you **do** use a subdomain, you'll need to configure the MX records for the subdomain.

![Adding MX records](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/adding-MX-records.png)

Repeat this step for the other (**mxb**.eu.mailgun.org) MX record.

### CNAME record

Lastly, add a CNAME record for the "email" subdomain: 

![Expected CNAME record](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/expected-CNAME-record.png)

![Adding CNAME record](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/adding-CNAME-record.png)

### Verify DNS Settings

After you've configured the DNS records, hit 'verify DNS settings' on the Mailgun page after which a green tick should appear, indicating that everything was properly configured.

You're now ready to send and receive incoming mail on this domain.

## Installing Laravel Mailbox

Pull in the [Laravel Mailbox](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-mailbox) package in your Laravel app using composer.

```bash
composer require beyondcode/laravel-mailbox
```

Following the installation instructions, at the [documentation](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/1.0/getting-started/installation.html) page:

**Publish the migrations**

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BeyondCode\Mailbox\MailboxServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

**Run the migrations**

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

**Publish the config file**

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BeyondCode\Mailbox\MailboxServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Now that the package is ready, let's dive into driving out some functionality using TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Testing

For this demo we will simply record a received e-mail in a `received_mails` table containing a 'sender', 'subject' and 'body' of the e-mail. We'll drive out this behaviour using a feature test.

```bash
php artisan make:test IncomingMailTest
```

### Setting up our test

**Environment file**

To be able to test this package locally, instead of receiving a call to the Mailgun webhook, the Laravel Mailbox package can listen to e-mails sent to the **log**. Therefore, we can specify `MAIL_DRIVER=log` and `MAILBOX_DRIVER=log` in our .env file.

**Using the log driver in our tests**

In the setup method of our test, we have to explicitly tell PHPunit to use the log driver, otherwise it will default to the "array" driver.

```php
class IncomingMailTest extends TestCase {
   use RefreshDatabase;

   public function setUp(): void
   {
       parent::setUp();

       config(['mail.driver' => 'log']);
   }
}
```

### Writing a test by wishful thinking

Let's write a test that will verify incoming e-mails are saved to the database, so we can later act on them. *Note:* *not all of the code described exists yet, we'll let our test tell us to implement / write the missing pieces*.

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use App\ReceivedMail;
use App\Mail\TestMail;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

class IncomingEmailTest extends TestCase {

  + setUp() ...

  /** @test **/
  function incoming_mail_is_saved_to_the_mails_table() {
    // Given: we have an e-mailï»¿
    $email = new TestMail(
            $sender = 'sender@example.com',
            $subject = 'Test E-mail',
            $body = 'Some example text in the body'
        );

    // When: we receive that e-mail
    Mail::to('incoming@johnbraun.blog')->send($email);

    // Then: we assert the e-mails (meta)data was stored
    $this->assertCount(1, ReceivedMail::all());

    tap(ReceivedMail::first(), function ($mail) use ($sender, $subject, $body) {
        $this->assertEquals($sender, $mail->sender);    
        $this->assertEquals($subject, $mail->subject);    
        $this->assertContains($body, $mail->body);    
    });
  }
}
```

**Note:** Are you new to Laravel's `tap()` function? Check out [Taylor Otwell's post](https://medium.com/@taylorotwell/tap-tap-tap-1fc6fc1f93a6) on one of his favorite helpers.

### Create a mailable

The first error we'll ecounter is that there is no IncomingTestMail mailable class, so let's create it:

php artisan make:mail TestMail --markdown="emails.tests.testmail"

Open up the mailable, and accept the sender's address, subject and body in the constructor and store them in the public properties.

```php
class TestMail extends Mailable {
    public $sender;
    public $subject;
    public $body;

    public function __construct($sender, $subject, $body) {
        $this->sender = $sender;
        $this->subject = $subject;
        $this->body = $body;
    }

    public function build() {
        return $this
            ->from($this->sender)
            ->subject($this->subject)
            ->markdown('tests.emails.testmail');
    }
}
```

In the markdown e-mail, echo out the body:

```html
@component('mail::message')

{{ $body }}

Thanks,<br>
{{ config('app.name') }}
@endcomponent
```

### Create a ReceivedMail model

If we run the test again at this stage, we're missing a ReceivedMail model, so let's create it, together with a migration.

```bash
php artisan make:model ReceivedMail -m
```

First, make all properties on our model fillable.

```php
class ReceivedMail extends Model {
    protected $guarded = [];
}
```

Next, add the 'sender', 'subject' and 'body' columns to our received_mails_table migration file.

```php
public function up() {
    Schema::create('received_mails', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->bigIncrements('id');
        $table->string('sender');
        $table->string('subject');
        $table->text('body');
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

Run the migration

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Defining a Mailbox

Running the test again, shows `Failed asserting that actual size 0 matches expected size 1`. This makes sense, since we don't act on incoming mail yet. We can easily set up a listener in the AppServiceProvider, referring incoming e-mails addressed **to** a certain address (`Mailbox::to()`) or **coming from** a specific address (`Mailbox::from()`) to a **callback** or - as we'll use in this case - an **invokable** MailHandler class. To learn all of the available options, check out [this page](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/1.0/basic-usage/mailboxes.html#matching-sender-emails) in the documentation.

```php
use App\MailHandler;
use BeyondCode\Mailbox\Facades\Mailbox;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
    public function boot() {
        Mailbox::to('incoming@johnbraun.blog', MailHandler::class);
    }
}
```

***Note:*** *you are able to use parameters (*[*see docs*](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/1.0/basic-usage/mailboxes.html#using-parameters)*) in the matching rules, which will be passed down to the handling class as additional arguments to the* `*InboundEmail $email*`*.*

### Create an invokable MailHandler class

In the app folder, let's create MailHandler.php and set up a magic `__invoke()` method, which gets passed in an `InboundEmail` object where we can call a from(), subject() and text() methods to obtain the corresponding data. All [available methods](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/1.0/basic-usage/handling.html#available-methods) are listed in the documentation.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use App\ReceivedMail;
use BeyondCode\Mailbox\InboundEmail;

class MailHandler {
    public function __invoke(InboundEmail $email) {
        ReceivedMail::create([
            'sender'    => $email->from(),
            'subject'   => $email->subject(),
            'body'      => $email->text(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Our test is passing

If we run our test now, it passes which means we can now listen for e-mails to 'incoming@our-domain.com', however we still first need to setup an endpoint for Mailgun, which we'll do in the next section.

## Setting up for production

### Installing GuzzleHTTP

Since Laravel requires Guzzle for working with the Mailgun driver, let's first install this dependency:

```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

### Configuring a webhook in Mailgun

We're almost ready to receive inbound e-mails on our domain, we just need to configure Mailgun to call our application whenever it receives mail. To do this, first push your application to the domain and make sure it is accessible (externally).

In Mailgun, hit up the "receiving" link in the menu and choose "create route". Here we can specify to either catch all e-mails, or a selection. Let's only catch e-mails sent to "incoming@johnbraun.blog".

![Route for incoming mail](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/route-incoming-mail.png)

Check "store and notify" and fill in the endpoint for the Mailgun driver (as [described here](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/1.0/drivers/drivers.html#mailgun)): `https://****your domain****/laravel-mailbox/mailgun/mime`. Give your route a description and hit the create button.

### Update production environment variables

Lastly, we'll need to specify the Mailgun driver in the environment file. Add/update the following properties in your .env file. The Mailgun secret key is obtained from the "API security" page under the "settings" tab. You'll need to provide the private key.

```
MAILBOX_DRIVER=mailgun
MAILBOX_MAILGUN_KEY=......

MAIL_DRIVER=mailgun
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=johnbraun.blog
MAILGUN_SECRET=........
MAILGUN_ENDPOINT="api.eu.mailgun.net"
```

![API settings page](/images/posts/incoming-mail-laravel-mailbox/API-settings.png)

## Ready for action!

At this stage, you're able to send mails to your defined address (in our demo case 'incoming@johnbraun.blog') after which a new `ReceivedMail` model wil be saved to the database.

Don't forget, that there are a lot of other things you could do. To name a few: it can handle attachments, send an auto-reply, capture the HTML contents of the e-mail, etc.

Check the available methods in the Laravel Mailbox [documentation](https://docs.beyondco.de/laravel-mailbox/1.0/basic-usage/handling.html#handling-inbound-emails).

I hope this post helped you to make a start if you're interested to start receiving and handling inbound e-mail.
