## Introduction 

A question popping up every now and then is how to let users log in to separate (child) applications using a single account they own on a central application.

In this post I try to explain how to achieve this infrastructure, by creating a central application using [**Laravel Passport**](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/passport) (`example.com`) where users register once and then use [**OAuth2**](https://oauth.net/2/) to grant access to their account to the other applications (`app1.example.com`, `app2.example.com`, etc.) using [**Laravel Socialite**](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/socialite). *Note: the applications do not necessarily have to use the same domain.*

In this way, users will be able to login to the child applications without creating a new, separate account.

If you're not yet familiar with the OAuth2 protocol, I've included a section on the how and what below.

## What is OAuth2?

Before jumping into Laravel Passport, it is important to understand the OAuth protocol it implements.

OAuth is an open standard, designed to provide **API access delegation**. Think of using a **third party** Twitter app which can tweet **on your behalf** to the Twitter platform. I explicitly mention [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) since development of this standard was (amongst others) driven by lead developer [Blane Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Cook_(programmer)), in need of authorization of external parties.

After initial release of version 1.0 in 2010, the protocol matured over the course of 2 years after which version 2.0 was released. This improved protocol offers support for **Bearer tokens** and provides "specific **authorization flows** for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and smart devices." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth))

Let's have a look at what is meant with the terms *"Bearer token"* and *"authorization flow"* .

### Bearer Tokens

The word "Bearer" means you're in possession of a certain (access) token. The bearer being the third party application, which possesses an **access** **token** issued by the **identity provider**. This token provides **immediate access** to a resource, without requiring a username and password. All necessary information is linked to this token, including user details and the **scope** of possible actions this third party may perform on behalf of this user.

The bearer token is usually included in the Headers of a GET or POST request to an API endpoint. A concrete example of using the Bearer token is shown below, making a GET request to '/api/user' using the [Guzzle HTTP library](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/) to a corresponding API endpoint sending along a Bearer Authorization header.

```php
$response = $client->request('GET', '/api/user', [
    'headers' => [
        'Accept' => 'application/json',
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $accessToken,
    ],
]);
```

### Authorization Flow

Now that we know what a Bearer access token is ... how do we obtain one?

First, let's look at the formal roles in OAuth2:

-   **- Resource Owner**: *the user who wants to login and delegate access to their account details to a third party application*
-   **- Resource Server**: *the server (API) where the user has an account*
-   **- Client**: *the third party application that wants to access the account information on the resource server*

The OAuth 2.0 protocol performs a standard communication flow between **Client** and **Resource Server**, where each step and given/required parameters are defined in advance. Ultimately, the **Client** receives the Bearer **access token** from the **Resource server**. This process is illustrated in the figure below (created using [draw.io](https://draw.io)). Note: it is assumed that the **Client** (third party application) is registered with the **Resource Server**.

![The OAuth authorization flow](/images/posts/oauth2-authentication-across-laravel-projects/oauth-scheme.png)

After this little "dance", the **Client** now possesses an **access token** which can either be long-lived or short-lived (more secure). If the access token is **short-lived**, the **Resource Server** will also provide a **refresh token** which can be used - in combination with the **client secret** - to obtain a new access token in a way resembling Step 3 in the diagram above. *Note: the "state" parameter is used to prevent CSRF related attacks, by verifying the request is not forged.*

Now, let's see how Laravel Passport implements this protocol.

## Laravel Passport

In case of our example, we want the **identity provider** (`example.com`) to make use of Laravel Passport.

Laravel Passport is an OAuth2 server, built upon the [League OAuth2 server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server). It provides an easy implementation for existing Laravel applications by requiring the composer package.

### Setting up the Resource Server

Follow the clear [installation instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/passport#installation) and/or watch [this explanation on Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5-3/episodes/13) by Taylor Otwell. Don't forget to add the `hasApiTokens` trait to your User model.

After installation, you now have the possiblity to add new **Clients** having a **callback url** and an automatically generated **secret**. For each of the "child" applications (`app1.example.com`, `app2.example.com`, etc.) you need to create a new **Client** with their own callback, for now you might choose `https://app1.example.com/login/callback` for example (we will come back to this).

![Creating a new Client in Laravel Passport](/images/posts/oauth2-authentication-across-laravel-projects/create-client.png)

Laravel Passport will take care of the authorization dialog, providing an authorization code, verifying the client secret in combination with the authorization code and lastly provide a `User` object and (by default) a **long-lived** access token. The lifespan of the access and refresh tokens are [configurable](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/passport#token-lifetimes).

## Laravel Socialite

Now that we have set-up the **Resource Server** (identity provider), we need to take care of the **Client** side of things.

Besides Passport, Laravel offers a package called [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/socialite), which will take care of the **Client** side of things when authenticating via OAuth2.

Out of the box, it allows authentication with the services of *Facebook*, *Twitter*, *LinkedIn*, *Google*, *GitHub*, *GitLab* and *Bitbucket*.

### Socialite Providers

However, there is a [collection of additional providers](https://socialiteproviders.netlify.com/), amongst which an adapter supporting ***Laravel Passport***.

### Setting up the Client

To achieve a shared login system across multiple Laravel applications, my proposed solution involves making use of the [Socialite provider for Laravel Passport.](https://socialiteproviders.netlify.com/providers/laravel-passport.html)

Looking at the installation instructions of the Socialite provider, there are quite a number of steps, to make sure a client application is able to identify users using the Laravel Passport identity provider.

1.  Install Laravel Socialite
2.  Install Laravel Passport **provider** for Socialite
3.  Add methods to LoginController
4.  Copy the 'laravelpassport' **config** to config/services.php
5.  Add 'SocialiteWasCalled' **event** and listener to EventServiceProvider

Now, this seems like a lot of steps to repeat for every **Client** application we might already have and want to couple to our **Resource Server**. That's why I made a package (see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhnbrn90/socialite-passport)) that combines Laravel Socialite with the Passport driver and can be configured in a more efficient way.

---

## Socialite-Passport package

![](/images/posts/oauth2-authentication-across-laravel-projects/passport-socialite-repository.png)

In a **Client** Laravel application that you want to couple to the Passport **Resource Server**, first install the custom ['socialite-passport' package](https://github.com/jhnbrn90/socialite-passport):

```bash
composer require jhnbrn90/socialite-passport
```

Next, publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JhnBrn90\SocialitePassport\SocialitePassportServiceProvider" --tag="config"ï»¿
```

This will publish a file `socialite-passport.php` in the `config` directory, in which you can define which Controller (defaults to `LoginController` that ships with Laravel) and which method should be called when the login route (also configurable) is called.

```php
return [
    'controller' => [
        'class' => \App\Http\Controllers\Auth\LoginController::class,
        'method' => 'loginWithPassport',
    ],

    'route' => [
        'name' => 'login',
        'uri' => '/login',
    ],
];
```

Assuming the defaults in the above configuration, after Authorization is granted by the **Resource Owner** at the **Resource Server** (Laravel Passport), the method `loginWithPassport()` will be called and a `User` object will be injected. This method needs to be implemented in the defined controller (in our example, the `LoginController`):

```php
class LoginController extends Controller 
{
    public function loginWithPassport($user) 
    {
        // example:
        User::firstOrCreate(['name' => $user['name'], 'email' => ...]);
    }
}
```

To be able to provide the **Resource Server** with a `client_id`, `callback_uri`, etc. you must add these variables to your `.env` file:

```
LARAVELPASSPORT_CLIENT_ID=
LARAVELPASSPORT_CLIENT_SECRET=
LARAVELPASSPORT_REDIRECT_URI=/login/callback
LARAVELPASSPORT_HOST=https://example.comï»¿
```

Remember, the `LARAVELPASSPORT_CLIENT_ID` and `LARAVELPASSPORT_CLIENT_SECRET` come from the Laravel Passport **Resource Server**, where the **Client** needs to be created first.

The package will make sure to match the route you provide as the `LARAVELPASSPORT_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable and proxies the request through the corresponding method and controller you've configured in the config file.

## Conclusion

That is all it takes to implement a basic functional shared login system.

I hope this post could shed some light on the OAuth2 protocol and how it can be used with the mentioned tools to achieve a shared authentication system amongst different Laravel projects.

It might be a good idea to also store the access token (and the resource token) on the user model to be able to update information whenever a user changes its profile on the **Resource Server**. Or to collect other data of that user from the Resource Server of course.

### Summary

- [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/passport) implements a fully functional OAuth2 server (Resource Server)
- [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/socialite) implements a way to authenticate with an OAuth2 server (Client)
- The [Socialite provider](https://socialiteproviders.netlify.com/providers/laravel-passport.html) for Laravel Passport allows authentication with Laravel Passport
- Clients can be prepared using [this package](https://github.com/jhnbrn90/socialite-passport) combining both Socialite with the Passport adapter
