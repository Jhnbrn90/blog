## Introduction
In a recent talk at the [Laracon EU Online](https://laracon.eu/online/discover/conference/?21) conference, my colleague [Jeroen Groenendijk](https://jeroeng.dev/) highlighted the significance of  *Mutation Testing* in achieving **greater confidence** in the (PHPUnit) **test suite** of your application. 

If you've ever wondered *"Are the current tests adding any value? Do they cover the edge cases?"*, truth is... if you're solely relying on PHPUnit's code coverage metrics, you might be missing out.

In this blog post I would like to explain the core concepts of [Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) and how to get started right away using [Infection PHP](https://infection.github.io/) by [Maks Rafalko](https://twitter.com/maks_rafalko) to improve your test suite.

## What is mutation testing
Given you've written (PHPUnit) tests covering your application's logic, a mutation testing tool will manipulate (*mutate*) pieces of your source code and run this *mutant* against your test suite. This code change **should** trigger a failing (unit) test, otherwise the mutant **escapes**. Escaped mutants are most likely a sign of weakly tested code.

The mutation framework will create mutations which manipulate different aspects of this function. In the example below (see diagram), the `add()` function is mutated in three ways:

>- The method executes the logic, but returns `null`
- The `+` operator is exchanged for the `-` operator
- The method visibility is changed from `public` to `protected`

Make sure to checkout the [all available mutators](https://infection.github.io/guide/mutators.html).

What mutation testing tells us in this case, is that `public` visibility might be too broad for the `add()` method and can be easily changed to `protected` or even `private`. This leads to the best practice of limiting the public API of the class this method belongs to.

## Using Infection PHP
Infection requires a recent version of PHP (>= 7.2) and either [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/), [phpdbg](https://infection.github.io/guide/usage.html#Running-with-phpdbg) (ships with PHP), or [pcov](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov/blob/develop/INSTALL.md) enabled. Make sure to check out the [LearnXDebug](https://learnxdebug.com/) site for setting up Xdebug in Laravel setups. In the steps below, I'll assume having xDebug installed. 

While you have [multiple options](https://infection.github.io/guide/installation.html) to install Infection, I would recommend requiring it as a `dev` dependency within your project.

#### Step 1. Require infection/infection with composer
Require the Infection as a dev dependency within your project.

```bash
composer require --dev infection/infection
```

#### Step 2. Run Infection from the project's root.
```bash
vendor/bin/infection
```


On the first run, Infection will ask for some input:

> - Directories to include:
    - For **Laravel projects** this means your `app` directory.
    - For **PHP packages** this generally means the `src` directory.
- Excluding directories from source directories:
    - Leave this blank, unless you have PHP code living in the source directory that shouldn't be mutated.
- Where to store the text log file:
    - I would recommend saving the mutations to *e.g.* `infection.log`. All escaped mutants are saved here for later review.
    - Alternatively, you may run the mutation tests with the `--show-mutations` option to log the mutations to the terminal output.

## A practical example
To demonstrate Mutation Testing in practice, I'll borrow the example from Jeroen's talk. 

Imagine having a `ShippingCalculator` service class to determine if a passed in `Product` qualifies for free shipping. For simplicityâ€™s sake, let's say the `Product` class accepts a `$price` integer through its constructor and provides public access to a `$shipsForFree` property.

The `ShippingCalculator` class determines that a `Product` receives free shipping when: 
- The price is equal or greater than the threshold (set to an arbitrary value)
- The product's `$shipsForFree` property is truthy

```php
class ShippingCalculator
{
    const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 20;
    
    public static function hasFreeShipping(Product $product): bool
    {        
        if ($product->price >= self::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if ($product->shipsForFree) {
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
### Testing the code with PHPUnit
To make sure the `ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShipping()` method works properly, we can think of adding the following unit tests to ensure proper behavior:

- When a product's `$price` exceeds the threshold, it should ship for free
- When a product's `$price` does not exceed the threshold, it should not ship for free
- When a product's `$shipsforFree` property set to `true`, it should ship for free

```php
class ShippingCalculatorTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    function product_ships_for_free_when_price_is_above_treshold()
    {
        $product = new Product($price = ShippingCalculator::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD + 1);
        
        $this->assertTrue(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
    }

    /** @test */
    function product_does_not_ship_for_free_when_price_is_below_treshold()
    {
        $product = new Product($price = ShippingCalculator::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD - 1);
        
        $this->assertFalse(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
    }
    
    /** @test */
    function product_ships_for_free_when_ships_for_free_property_is_true()
    { 
        $product = new Product(ShippingCalculator::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD - 1);
        $product->shipsForFree = true;
        
        $this->assertTrue(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
    }
}
```

With only these three tests, the code coverage report from PHPUnit (which you can generate using `vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text`) reveals a code coverage of 100% for both classes. 

```bash
 Summary:
  Classes: 100.00% (2/2)
  Methods: 100.00% (2/2)
  Lines:   100.00% (7/7)
```

### Running Infection PHP
Now, we'll run Infection PHP using `vendor/bin/infection` and see if any mutants escape.

```bash
Processing source code files: 2/2
.: killed, M: escaped, U: uncovered, E: fatal error, T: timed out, S: skipped

.M....                                               (6 / 6)

6 mutations were generated:
       5 mutants were killed
       0 mutants were not covered by tests
       1 covered mutants were not detected
       0 errors were encountered
       0 time outs were encountered
       0 mutants required more time than configured

Metrics:
         Mutation Score Indicator (MSI): 83%
         Mutation Code Coverage: 100%
         Covered Code MSI: 83%
```

Oh no, a mutant has escaped! 

Further more, our **MSI** is **83%**, while the generated mutations covered 100% of the code. This means 5 out of 6 mutants were killed.  

When we check our log file, we see the `[M] GreaterThanOrEqualTo` mutant escaped:

```bash
Escaped mutants:
================
1) ../src/ShippingCalculator.php:15    [M] GreaterThanOrEqualTo

--- Original
+++ New
@@ @@
-        if ($product->price >= self::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD) {
+        if ($product->price > self::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD) {
```

### The missing test
Now it becomes obvious that we are **missing a crucial test**: we did not assert what happens when the `$price` is **equal** to the free shipping threshold. 

Infection PHP expected at least one of our tests to fail when mutating the conditional from a `great-than-or-equals` to a `greater-than` comparison. Since our test suite didn't fail, this mutation got away unnoticed.   

Let's fix that by adding in the "forgotten" boundary test:  

```php
/** @test */
function product_ships_for_free_when_price_equals_threshold()
{
    $product = new Product(ShippingCalculator::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD);

    $this->assertTrue(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
}
```

When we run Infection again, we get a MSI of 100%. No escaped mutants this time!

## Personal experience
After using mutation testing in a few of my personal - Laravel - projects, I learned that mutation testing really drives out tests I would've otherwise skipped (for example testing added **query scopes** to my models). 

Another example is when I redirected a user to a specific page with a "date" parameter from my `store()` controller action.

```php
class AppointmentController
{
    public function store()
    {
        // controller logic
        
        return redirect(route('appointments.index', ['date' => $date]));
    }
}
```

In my test for this controller action, I initially did not include a check that the user was redirected to a specific page. However, when running the Infection PHP mutation test suite I got the following **escaped mutant**: 

```bash
3) app/Http/Controllers/AppointmentController.php:163    [M] ArrayItemRemoval

--- Original
+++ New
@@ @@
-        return redirect(route('appointments.index', ['date' => $date]));
+        return redirect(route('appointments.index', []));
     }
 }
```

This redirect is crucial for users to land on the appropriate page, however I wasn't testing this in my PHPUnit tests. Thanks to mutation testing I've now added a test covering this scenario.

## Conclusion
Mutation testing is really cool and helps you fill in the gaps in your current PHPUnit tests. Although this blog post merely covers a couple of examples, I do see lots of use cases for mutation testing:

- Check appropriate validation of form inputs
- Check if middleware is applied
- Check if the correct parameters are being saved to the DB
- Finding unused / unnecessary code

### Potential drawbacks
Mutation testing also comes with possible drawbacks and there are some things to be aware of. 

- Not all mutants have to be killed
  - Trying to kill all mutants might lead to **tight coupling** between your code and your tests. Or lead to code that is *too strict* and no longer **flexible**.
