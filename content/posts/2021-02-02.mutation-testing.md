## Introduction
In a recent talk at the [Laracon EU Online](https://laracon.eu/online/discover/conference/?21) conference, my colleague [Jeroen Groenendijk](https://jeroeng.dev/) highlighted the significance of  *Mutation Testing* in achieving **greater confidence** in the (PHPUnit) **test suite** of your application. 

If you've ever wondered *"Are the current tests adding any value? Do they cover the edge cases?"*, truth is... if you're solely relying on PHPUnit's code coverage metrics, you might be missing out.

In this blog post I would like to explain the core concepts of [Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) and how to get started right away using the [Infection PHP](https://infection.github.io/) package by [Maks Rafalko](https://twitter.com/maks_rafalko) to improve your test suite.

## What is mutation testing
Given you've written (PHPUnit) tests covering your application's logic, a mutation testing tool will manipulate (*mutate*) pieces of your source code and run this *mutant* against your test suite. This code change **should** trigger a failing (unit) test, otherwise the mutant **escapes**. Escaped mutants are most likely a sign of weakly tested code.

The mutation framework will create mutations which manipulate different aspects of this function, for example the returned result or the visibility (public, protected, private).

![Mutation Testing Diagram](diagram.png)

In the diagram above, the `add()` function is mutated in three ways:

- The returned result is nullified
- The plus operator is exchanged for the minus operator
- The method's signature is changed from `public` to `protected`

What mutation testing tells us is in this example is that the `public` signature might be too broad and easily changed to `protected` or even `private`, limiting the public API of the class this method belongs to.

## Setting up Mutation Testing
The Infection PHP mutation testing framework provides a CLI tool which can be either installed globally or executed from your project's root. Infection requires a recent version of PHP (>= 7.2) and XDebug, phpdbg, or pcov enabled.

Step 1. Require Infection as a dev dependency within your project.

```bash
composer require --dev infection/infection
```

Step 2. Run `vendor/bin/infection` from the project's root.

On the first run, Infection will ask for some input.

```bash
Which source directories do you want to include (comma separated)? [src]:
  [0] .
  [1] src
  [2] tests
  [3] vendor
 >
```

Infection will ask you which directories you want to include. For **Laravel projects** this means your `app` directory. For **PHP packages** this generally means the `src` directory.

```bash
Any directories to exclude from within your source directories?:
```

If your tests are separated from the source code (i.e. they do not live in the same directory), you can leave this question blank and hit enter.

```bash
Where do you want to store the text log file?:
```

I would highly recommend saving the mutations to a `infection.log` file for example. Infection PHP will now save all escaped mutants for later review within this file. Alternatively, you may run the mutation tests with the `--show-mutations` option to log the mutations to the terminal output.

## Examples

Borrowing the **example** from Jeroen's talk, let's imagine we have a `ShippingCalculator` class to determine if a `Product` qualifies for free shipping.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class ShippingCalculator
{
    const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 20;
    
    public static function hasFreeShipping(Product $product): bool
    {
        if ($product->shipsForFree) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if ($product->price >= self::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD) {
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

The `Product` class accepts a `$price` integer through its constructor and provides public access to a `shipsForFree` property to keep things simple. 

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Product
{
    public int $price;
    public bool $shipsForFree = false;

    public function __construct(int $price)
    {
        $this->price = $price;
    }

    public function hasFreeShipping()
    {
        if ($this->price > 20) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if ($this->shipsForFree) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

Next, let's add some basic tests for the `ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShipping()` method. 

```php
<?php

namespace Tests;

use App\Product;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ShippingCalculatorTest extends TestCase
{
    protected int $threshold = ShippingCalculator::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD;
    
    public function test_product_with_price_above_treshold_ships_for_free()
    {
        $product = new Product($this->threshold + 1);
        
        $this->assertTrue(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
    }

    public function test_product_with_price_below_treshold_does_not_ship_for_free()
    {
        // Create a product with half the price of the free shipping treshold
        $product = new Product($this->threshold / 2);
        
        $this->assertFalse(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
    }
    
    public function test_product_with_ships_for_free_property_ships_for_free()
    { 
        $product = new Product($this->threshold / 2);
        $product->shipsForFree = true;
        
        $this->assertTrue(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
    }
}
```

At this stage, running the test suite is passing with a code coverage of 100% for both classes.

```bash
 Summary:
  Classes: 100.00% (2/2)
  Methods: 100.00% (2/2)
  Lines:   100.00% (7/7)
```

However, when we run the mutation tests (`vendor/bin/infection`), we see that a mutant has escaped!

```bash
Processing source code files: 2/2
.: killed, M: escaped, U: uncovered, E: fatal error, T: timed out, S: skipped

.M....                                               (6 / 6)

6 mutations were generated:
       5 mutants were killed
       0 mutants were not covered by tests
       1 covered mutants were not detected
       0 errors were encountered
       0 time outs were encountered
       0 mutants required more time than configured

Metrics:
         Mutation Score Indicator (MSI): 83%
         Mutation Code Coverage: 100%
         Covered Code MSI: 83%
```

Our MSI score is 83%, while 100% of the mutation tests are covered by our code. This is a discrepancy of 17%, 

When we check our log file, we see the `[M] GreaterThanOrEqualTo` mutant escaped:

```bash
Escaped mutants:
================
1) ../src/ShippingCalculator.php:15    [M] GreaterThanOrEqualTo

--- Original
+++ New
@@ @@
-        if ($product->price >= self::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD) {
+        if ($product->price > self::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD) {
```

When our source code was mutated to set the conditional true for prices only greather than the threshold all unit tests still passed. This is easily solved by adding another test, which covers the edge case:

```php
public function test_product_price_equal_to_threshold_ships_for_free()
{
    $product = new Product(ShippingCalculator::FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD);

    $this->assertTrue(ShippingCalculator::hasFreeShippingCosts($product));
}
```

After adding in this final test, the MSI score is at 100%.
