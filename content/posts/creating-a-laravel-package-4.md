## Introduction

Sometimes, you want to expose additional routes to the end use of your package.

Since we're offering a `Post` model, let's add some RESTful routes. To keep things simple, we're just going to implement 3 of the RESTful routes: showing all posts ('index'), showing a single post ('show') and storing a new post ('store').

## Controllers

### Creating a base controller

To this extent, we want to create a `PostController`. To make use of some traits the Laravel controllers offer, we'll first create our own base controller containing these traits in a `src/Http/Controllers` directory (resembling Laravel's folder structure) named Controller.php:

```php
// 'src/Http/Controllers/Controller.php'
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\DispatchesJobs;
use Illuminate\Routing\Controller as BaseController;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Validation\ValidatesRequests;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\Access\AuthorizesRequests;

class Controller extends BaseController {
    use AuthorizesRequests, DispatchesJobs, ValidatesRequests;
}
```

### Creating a controller that extends base controller

Now, let's create a `PostController` in the `src/Http/Controllers` directory, with the methods 'index', 'show' and 'store'. We can flesh out the store() method as indicated below, but we'll save the 'index' and'show' methods to return a view, which we'll discuss in the next section.

```php
// 'src/Http/Controllers/PostController'
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Http\Controllers;

class PostController extends Controller {
    public function index() {
        //
    }

    public function show() {
        //
    }

    public function store() {
        // Let's assume we need to be authenticated
        // to create a new post
        if (! auth()->check()) {
            abort (403, 'Only authenticated users can create new posts.');
        }

        request()->validate([
            'title' => 'required',
            'body'  => 'required',
        ]);

        // Assume the authenticated user is the post's author
        $author = auth()->user();

        $post = $author->posts()->create([
            'title'     => request('title'),
            'body'      => request('body'),
        ]);

        return redirect(route('posts.show', $post));
    }
}
```

## Routes

### Adding a routes file

Now that we have a controller, create a new `routes/` directory in the root of our package and add a web.phpfile containing the three RESTful routes we've mentioned above.

```php
// 'routes/web.php'
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Http\Controllers\PostController;

Route::get('/posts', [PostController::class, 'index'])->name('posts.index');
Route::get('/posts/{post}', [PostController::class, 'show'])->name('posts.show');
Route::post('/posts', [PostController::class, 'store'])->name('posts.store');

### Registering routes in the service provider

Before we can use these routes, we need to register them in the `boot()` method of our Service Provider:

// 'BlogPackageServiceProvider.php'
public function boot() {ï»¿
  // ... other things
  $this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'../../routes/web.php');
}
```

## Views

The 'index' and 'show' methods on the PostController need to render a view.

### Creating a 'views' directory

Create a new `resources/` folder in the root of our package. In that folder, create a subfolder named `views`. In the `views` folder we'll create another subfolder `posts` in which we'll create two (extremely) simple templates.

### Creating our blade view files:

resources/views/posts/index.blade.php:
```html
<h1>Showing all Posts</h1>

@forelse ($posts as $post)
    <li>{{ $post->title }}</li>
@empty
    <p> 'No posts yet' </p>
@endforelse

and resources/views/posts/show.blade.php:

<h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

<p> {{ $post->body }}</p>
```

Note: these templates would extend a base / master layout file in a real world scenario, but I'm just keeping things simple for now.

### Loading the views in the service provider

Now that we have some views, we need to register that we want to load any views from our `resources/views` directory in the `boot()` method of our Service Provider. Important: provide a "key" as the second argument to `loadViewsFrom()` as you'll need to specify this key when returning a view from a controller (see next section).

```php
// 'BlogPackageServiceProvider.php'
public function boot() {
  // ... other things
  $this->loadViewsFrom(__DIR__.'/../resources/views', 'blogpackage');
}
```

### Returning the views from the controller

Return these views in the corresponding methods in the `PostController` (don't forget to import our `Post` model):

```php
// 'src/Http/Controllers/PostController.php'
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Models\Post;

public function index() {
    $posts = Post::all();

    return view('blogpackage::posts.index', compact('posts'));
}

public function show() {
    $post = Post::findOrFail(request('post'));

    return view('blogpackage::posts.show', compact('post'));
}
```

**Making the views publishable**

Now chances are that you want to be able to let the users of your package customize the views. Similar to the database migrations, the views can be published if we register them to be exported in the `boot()` method of our service provider under the 'views' key:

```php
// 'BlogPackageServiceProvider.php'
if ($this->app->runningInConsole()) {
  // publish database migrations

  $this->publishes([
    __DIR__.'/../resources/views' => resource_path('views/vendor/blogpackage'),
  ], 'views');

}
```

The views can then be exported by users of our package using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JohnDoe\BlogPackage\BlogPackageServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

## Assets

### Creating an 'assets' directory

If you want to use a CSS stylesheet and/or include a javascript file in your views, create an `assets` directory in the `resources/` folder. Since we might include several stylesheets and/or javascript files let's create two subfolders: `css` and `js` to store these files respectively. A convention is to name the main javascript file app.js and the main stylesheet app.css.

### Making the assets publishable

First, we'll determine where we'll export the assets in the `boot()` method of our service provider under the 'assets' key in a '`blogpackage`' directory in the public path of the end user's Laravel app:

```php
// 'BlogPackageServiceProvider.php'
if ($this->app->runningInConsole()) {
  // publish database migrations

  // publish views

  $this->publishes([
    __DIR__.'/../resources/assets' => public_path('blogpackage'),
    ], 'assets');

}
```

Exporting the assets to the end user's Laravel project:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JohnDoe\BlogPackage\BlogPackageServiceProvider" --tag="assets"
```

### Referencing the assets

Then, we can reference the javascript file in our views as:

```html
<script src="{{ asset('blogpackage/js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

And our stylesheet as:

```html
<link href="{{ asset('blogpackage/css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Testing the routing

Let's verify that we can indeed create a post, show a post and show all posts with our provided routes, views and controllers.

### Creating a Feature test

Create a new Feature test called CreatePostTest.php in the `tests/Feature` directory and add the following assertions to verify that authenticated users can indeed create new posts:

```php
// 'tests/Feature/CreatePostTest.php'
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Models\Post;
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\TestCase;
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\User;

class CreatePostTest extends TestCase {
    use RefreshDatabase;

    /** @test */
    function authenticated_users_can_create_a_post() {
        // To make sure we don't start with a Post
        $this->assertCount(0, Post::all());

        $author = factory(User::class)->create();

        $response = $this->actingAs($author)->post(route('posts.store'), [
            'title' => 'My first fake title',
            'body'  => 'My first fake body',
        ]);

        $this->assertCount(1, Post::all());

        tap(Post::first(), function ($post) use ($response, $author) {
            $this->assertEquals('My first fake title', $post->title);
            $this->assertEquals('My first fake body', $post->body);
            $this->assertTrue($post->author->is($author));
            $response->assertRedirect(route('posts.show', $post));
        });
    }
}
```

Additionally, we could verify that we require both a "title" and a "body" attribute when creating a new post:

```php
// 'tests/Feature/CreatePostTest.php'
/** @test */
function a_post_requires_a_title_and_a_body() {
    $author = factory(User::class)->create();

    $this->actingAs($author)->post(route('posts.store'), [
        'title' => '',
        'body'  => 'Some valid body',
    ])->assertSessionHasErrors('title');

    $this->actingAs($author)->post(route('posts.store'), [
        'title' => 'Some valid title',
        'body'  => '',
    ])->assertSessionHasErrors('body');
}
```

Next, let's verify unauthenticated users (or "guests") can not create new posts:

```php
// 'tests/Feature/CreatePostTest.php'
/** @test */
function guests_can_not_create_posts() {
    // We're starting from an unauthenticated state
    $this->assertFalse(auth()->check());

    $this->post(route('posts.store'), [
       'title' => 'A valid title',
       'body'  => 'A valid body',
    ])->assertForbidden();
}
```

Finally, let's verify the index route shows all posts, and the show route shows a specific post:

```php
// 'tests/Feature/CreatePostTest.php'
/** @test */
function all_posts_are_shown_via_the_index_route() {
    // Given we have a couple of Posts
    factory(Post::class)->create([
        'title' => 'Post number 1'
    ]);
    factory(Post::class)->create([
        'title' => 'Post number 2'
    ]);
    factory(Post::class)->create([
        'title' => 'Post number 3'
    ]);

    // We expect them to all show up
    // with their title on the index route
    $this->get(route('posts.index'))
        ->assertSee('Post number 1')
        ->assertSee('Post number 2')
        ->assertSee('Post number 3')
        ->assertDontSee('Post number 4');
}

/** @test */
function a_single_post_is_shown_via_the_show_route() {
    $post = factory(Post::class)->create([
        'title' => 'The single post title',
        'body'  => 'The single post body',
    ]);

    $this->get(route('posts.show', $post))
        ->assertSee('The single post title')
        ->assertSee('The single post body');
}
```

Tip: whenever you are getting cryptic error messages from your tests, it might be helpful to disable graceful exception handling to get more insight in the origin of the error. You can do so by declaring `$this->withoutExceptionHandling();` at the start of your test.
